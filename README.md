# **HALCYON**  
**Helium-Adapted Learning for Confinement Yield Optimization using Neuromorphic AI**  

## **🌌 Mission Statement**  
Project **HALCYON** is a groundbreaking fusion research initiative aimed at simulating and optimizing **proton-proton chain fusion reactions** within a **stellarator reactor**. By leveraging a fusion of **AI, machine learning (ML), and neuromorphic computing**, HALCYON seeks to push the boundaries of **self-optimizing confinement, advanced plasma control, and engineering efficiency** in next-generation fusion energy.  

Our goal is to develop a **fully GPU-accelerated plasma physics simulator** that integrates **reactor engineering optimization, plasma confinement stability, and AI-driven control systems** to create an **adaptive stellarator design framework**.

## **🚀 Motivation**  
### **Why Stellarators?**  
Unlike tokamaks, **stellarators naturally offer steady-state plasma confinement** without requiring toroidal plasma currents, eliminating major stability issues like **disruptions**. However, stellarators have historically been more **challenging to design and optimize** due to their complex **3D magnetic field structures**. **HALCYON** aims to solve this problem by introducing **AI-driven optimization and real-time plasma simulation tools** that enhance reactor efficiency and design.  

### **Why Proton-Proton Chain Fusion?**  
While most terrestrial fusion research focuses on **deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion**, **HALCYON** explores the viability of **proton-proton (p-p) chain fusion**—the dominant reaction in stars.  
- **p-p chain fusion requires lower plasma densities** but significantly higher temperatures (~100 million K).  
- Unlike D-T fusion, it **produces no radioactive tritium and reduces neutron activation**, making it a **cleaner, more sustainable option**.  
- If successful, it could pave the way for **long-term stellarator-based fusion reactors** that mimic stellar nucleosynthesis.  

HALCYON will **simulate and optimize p-p chain reactions** to explore their feasibility within a stellarator framework, developing **advanced confinement and heating strategies**.
